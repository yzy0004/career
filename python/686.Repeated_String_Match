686. Repeated String Match

Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").

Note:
The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.


class Solution(object):
    def repeatedStringMatch(self, A, B):
        """
        :type A: str
        :type B: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        count=len(B)/len(A)
        if len(B)%len(A):
            count+=1
        for i in range(2):
            if B in A*(count+i):
                return count+i
        return -1


Improvement by using round negative to lower number and turn it back to positive again:

class Solution(object):
    def repeatedStringMatch(self, A, B):
        """
        :type A: str
        :type B: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        count=-(-len(B)/len(A))
        for i in range(2):
            if B in A*(count+i):
                return count+i
        return -1
