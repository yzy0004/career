246. Strobogrammatic Number


A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is represented as a string.

For example, the numbers "69", "88", and "818" are all strobogrammatic.

class Solution(object):
    def isStrobogrammatic(self, num):
        """
        :type num: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        l=len(num)
        for i in range(l/2+1):
            if num[i]+num[l-1-i] not in '696 00 11 88':
                return False
        return True



Online solution:
def isStrobogrammatic(self, num):
    return all(num[i] + num[~i] in '696 00 11 88' for i in range(len(num)/2+1))


The complement code of a index is the same sequence index from another end: ~0=-1, ~1=-2
