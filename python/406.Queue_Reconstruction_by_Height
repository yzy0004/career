406. Queue Reconstruction by Height


Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.




class Solution(object):
    def reconstructQueue(self, people):
        """
        :type people: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        re=[]
        people.sort(key=lambda(h,k):(-h,k))
        for p in people:
            re.insert(p[1],p)
        return re
